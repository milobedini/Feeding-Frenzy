# Feeding Frenzy

This game was created for the 1st project in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course.

A major challenge was creating moving objects (the sharks and the fish), and being able to always track where they were in order to interact with the player and be affected accordingly. The use of classes was instrumental for this.

Another challenge was preventing a fish that had been eaten reappearing when the player moved off the prey's location!

The stationary game objects (the plankton and the fish-nets) are generated randomly (with a max number for each set) upon each level commencing. I was particularly happy with the use of classes to be able to set each component's speed (and therefore game difficulty), and easily change the quantity of all the game's elements.
